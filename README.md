# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description
This project is the first step in building our own version of the AirBnB website. It's a full-stack clone project that starts with creating a command-line interpreter that manages the application's backend. The command interpreter allows us to create, read, update, and delete objects (like users, places, amenities, etc.).

This project will eventually expand to include a web application with a RESTful API, a dynamic front-end, and database storage.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is similar to a shell interface and is used to manage different objects used in the AirBnB clone project.
